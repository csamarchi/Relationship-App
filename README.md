# Unit 2 Project

## Alex Fields and Christine Samarchi


## User Story
This app is intended for anyone ages 18+. This app is designed to help aid you in determining if someone is a suitable to date. It will provide real feedback from people that have dated that individual in order to give you a first hand account of what it is like to be with them. It's Yelp for humans!

### Overview
Our Unit 2 project will be a dating app that will allow people to post reviews on their exes. They can list the good and/or bad qualities and then rate the dating experience. They will be allowed to post one picture of their ex as long as it is a moderate picture (ie no nudity, or anything that could embarrass them).

### Goals

Enable user ability to post as many reviews as they like
